Kaggle Competiton - Outbrain Click Prediction
The idea behind this machine learning competition was to process and find which of the given ads have higher probability of getting clicked. We did not follow the general approach of CTR in online advertisements but created our own idea of analyzing the relationship through various techniques to understand the latent relationship in data and use them to create a better predictive model for higher accuracy. We saw through Random Forest and Boosting techniques the result were indeed better considering the models we had created. The challenges we faced with this task was indeed with repspect to the data, we had to ensure that all the data we were using or discarding made valid through our model. The idea to overall increase the efficiency through ensemble techniques also paid off in overall percentage increase in efficiency.
